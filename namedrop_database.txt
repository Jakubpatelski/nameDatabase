What is difference between relational and NoSQL database?
Relational databases store data according to specific schemas.
 By contrast, NoSQL systems allow data to be stored using any structure required but provides a way for updating that data when changing that structure.

 In-memory databases vs. persistent
An in-memory database system (IMDS) is a database management system that stores data entirely in main memory.
 This contrasts to traditional (on-disk/persistent) database systems, which are designed store data on persistent media.
 Because working with data in memory is much faster than writing to and reading from a file system, IMDSs can perform applicationsâ€™ data management functions orders of magnitude faster.
 Because their design is typically simpler than that of persistent database systems, IMDSs can also impose significantly lower memory and CPU requirements.
